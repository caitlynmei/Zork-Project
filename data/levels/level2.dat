Room Description: WATER SURFACE <br> You are fighting for your life to keep your head above the water surface. Thankfully, you know how to swim. <br> You don't see anything above water other then dark gloomy clouds and murky water. There is just water, water, and more water. <br> (*HINT: go under the surface. It's more interesting)

Room Description: UNDER THE SEA (BELOW WATER SURFACE) <br> There is a colourful coral reef covering the sea floor. *You can now use the commands up (U) <br> and down (D) alongside the normal compass directions. The water surface is above you, but the <br> dark dullness doesn't seem inviting. The only way left is down.
