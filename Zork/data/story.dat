Ground is cold cement. You are wearing a T-Shirt and worn out jeans. You are wearing dress shoes covered in dust.
You don't remember who you are, where you came from or even what your name is. A dark figure approaches the cage shown by the 
little back light of the night sky.
  
Mysterious figure : 
"Look who decided to finally wake up"

*Evil Laughter sound*
The dark figure starts laughing as their figure fades from the dimly lit airplane hanger. 

.. wait about 3 seconds before executing next line of code .. 

*clicking sound*
Suddenly the ground beneath you collapses and you fall. Everything goes dark.



// we should have a leaflet to read instructions like Zork does - CM
//idk what that is - GG
// there was a mailbox in Zork where you read the intro to Zork. 
// Or at least have a game intro explanation - CM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1: Air World 

You wake up on a fluffy surface. You look around to see blue skies and the bright sun in the Morning sky.
Squinting, you look around to see a ground of white fluff which seems to resemble the clouds you are used to seeing above your head.
You try to remember how you got here, but only remember the scary figure that greeted you from outside the cage you were
trapped in. 

start level one


When you open the chest at the end of the level (or however u get out):


the clouds around you start to disappear one by one.

Options - 
Hang onto the chest - The chest disappears into thin air, you fall on your face.
Do nothing - You watch as the clouds around you disappear. Eventually the cloud underneath you also disappears. 
You Fall. Everything goes dark.
Close your eyes -  You close your eyes, and hope for the best. The anticipation is high and you anxiously wait for the cloud beneath
you, to disappear. You lose consciousness.  

You see a child skipping on a hot summers day. "Do I know her?" you ask yourself. She starts skipping away. "Wait!" you call. Everything
fades to black.
Start Level 2

Level 2: Water World

** Caitlyn make sure you think of the memories the guy gets back or just leave that to me when u r done - Gaby
->	goal of this world player has to find a key inside. 
	It is the golden key of truth. You dissolve into the sand and 
	reappear in Earth World (in a muddy swamp). 
	
You wake up lying on your back in pitch dark. You can hear the sound of waves crashing 
against cave walls.

You stand up cautiously.

// user has to move eventually, so any move will make you fall into a hole...

Ahhhhhhhhhh....... You fall into a deep dark hole and die...
Only joking! But you do fall into a hole and submerge into water. 
*SPLASH*

WATER SURFACE
You are fighting for your life to keep your head above the water surface. Thankfully, you 
know how to swim. You don't see anything above water other then dark gloomy clouds
and murky water. There is just water, water, and more water. 
(*HINT: go under the surface. It's more interesting)

// person goes underwater

UNDER THE SEA (BELOW WATER SURFACE)
There is a colourful coral reef covering the sea floor. *You can now use the commands up (U) 
and down (D) alongside the normal compass directions. The water surface is above you, but the
dark dullness doesn't seem inviting. The only way left is down. 

// person goes down

CORAL REEF
You are now on the sea floor with the exotic reefs. To the east, there is a sign. You realize
you are holding your breath under the water. You will run out of air soon. To the west, there 
is a trail of bubbles coming from something that looks like a large ... purple ... rock? 

// go west

GIANT PURPLE CLAM
There is a giant purple clam!! (In case you didn't read the title) You watch the clam breath
out a trail of bubbles. The bubbles float upwards on top of the clam. You think, that's cute. 
But, not really. You're head hurts. You NEED oxygen. Now. 

A small silver clownfish swims into the bubbles and is caught in one. *THINK* 
(*HINT: The bubbles have air. What do you need?)

// you swim up on top of the clam
// You take a bubble and place it on top of your head 
// If you DON'T, sadly you run out of air and suffocate. Sorry!! Good game. 

// if the user is an underwater astronaut...
Good thinking!! You're like an underwater astronaut with the bubble helmet. Now you're free
to 'traverse' the ocean as you wish. :)

//look
There is a sign to the east. 

// walk to the sign
// read sign

INTRO SIGN
"BEWARE: SHARK!!! 
Just stay inside the KELP FOREST to the east. 

// east

You see a shark!! Run away!!

// east

KELP FOREST
There is a vast wall of kelp looming over you. This forest has been proven to be a good 
hidding spot. To the west is a sign. 

KELP FOREST
You see kelp all around you in this thick and dim forest light. 

// east

KELP FOREST
You see a faint glow ahead in the midst of all the kelp.

// east

KELP FOREST
In the middle of the kelp forest, you see a glowing rock shaped like a "T". Hmmm...

// east

KELP FOREST
You see a beam of light to the east. 

// east

OTHER SIDE OF THE KELP FOREST
The light is glowing stronger... Hallelujah!! You are out of the kelp forest!! 
If you turn back you will die from the shark. There is a dark vast space of water beneath
you. It's a one way ride. (You can follow the wall down, where the sea floor drops off)

// down

MIDNIGHT ZONE
The abyss of gloom. It's actually not that scary. 
*Unless, you have a a fear of the dark. In that case, good luck 'cause 
this is the only path available for you. *MWAH HA HA HA*  // HAH OK - GG

// down

MIDNIGHT ZONE
Look! Pretty bioluminescent jellyfish let you see in the dark. 

// down
// on west side of midnight zone, there is glowing turqoise stone.

MIDNIGHT ZONE
There is a turqoise light coming from the west, on the side of the wall. 

// west; down

WALL LEDGE 
Oooh, a glowing truqoise stone is on the ledge. There is a note under the stone.

// take stone
// take note
// read note

MIDNIGHT ZONE NOTE
Good luck making if so far. If you still can't remember much right now, here's a clue. 

/ rhyme of whatever we want the guy to remember...
.
.
.
.

And there's also an "H". Hmmm... 

// any move

CURRENT MOVING DOWN
You are caught in a current!
Tumbling and tumbling and tumbling...
Deeper and deeper into the sea...
And...

ABYSS FLOOR // not actually in that room yet
Finally you stop. The current took you to the bottom of the abyss. You are on the floor of the abyss.
Another school of bioluminescent fish swim by. You see a another sign beside you. 

// read sign

ABYSS SIGN
Good job once more! Follow the path of the glow in the dark road.
"E" 
Hmmmm.... interesting, another letter.

// look
ABYSS FLOOR
Bottom of the abyss in the Midnight Zone. You are in pitch black darkness, surrounded 
by the mysterious, quiet, and beautiful creatures of the night. Their glowing helps 
you see. The sea wall is to the west. To the east, there is a trail of glowing luminous
rocks leading to a cave. There is nothing but emptiness to the north and south. 

//east -- cave

ABYSS CAVE ENTRANCE
The luminous rocks led you to, not a gingerbread house, but a cave entrance! How cool 
is that? You are in front of the cave. A huge spherical boulder blocks the entrance. There is
a keypad beside the boulder on the cave wall. 

// look at keypad
CAVE KEYPAD
It seems you have to enter a code. There are three blank spaces. It could be anything...

// person can't enter a code yet...

thread.sleep(5000)

*SWISH*
What was that? A red stripy thing just swam by... 
*WHAM*
You were knocked onto the sea floor by something. Your head banged onto the side of the cave. Thank 
goodness your oxygen bubble is still intact. Dizzy, you look up and see an infinitely giant and long 
silver fish. It's really, really long. Almost three times your height... And big... You shake your 
head to clear the blurriness. 

Nope. The fish is still there, guarding the cave entrance with a long, narrow silvery body, almost 
like a sea serpent. It has a very deep red dorsal fin, from its head all the way to its back. 
Wait, a red dorsal fin? 

Thinking, you realize it's an oarfish. You wonder for a split second why you even know that,
but the oarfish advances toward you. You back away, slowly pulling your body backwards with your 
hands. Unfortunately, there's no where to go. Your back is pressed against the cave wall. 

What do you do? It could eat you alive... It's definitely large enough to swallow you whole.

	Option 1: Remember that knife in your inventory? That might be useful. Enter '1'.
	Option 2: Think again. Use your head. Maybe, violence isn't the answer. Enter '2'.
	
	Option 1:
	You take the knife out, and stab as hard as you can into the oarfish's right side. 
	
	The oarfish's eyes are filled with hate and anger. In a milisecond, it flicks its tail and you 
	slam into the cave wall. *CRACK* That's going to leave more than a bruise... You almost blank out, 
	but it could also just be the darkness. 
	
	*POP*
	Or not... There goes your oxygen bubble... What a painful way to die... 
	
	// Person dies
	
	Option 2:
	No knife... be the kind hero that dies won't you? Another memory floods into your mind. A friend was giving you
	a lecture about deep sea creatures. Oarfish were gentle. 
	
	Cautiously, you remain silent and wait for the oarfish to come closer. Its eyes stare into yours. You slowly reach
	out a hand, and stroke its side. It bumps its head into you. You laugh. You just made a new friend!
	
	Good job! Never judge anyone by their mere appearance. Looks are always deceiving. 
	
	The oarfish nudges your hand to the keypad. 
	
Do you want to 'enter a code'?

	Option 1: Enter 'yes'.
	Option 2: Enter 'no'. 
	
	// answer to 'no'
	Okaaay, have fun waiting outside. Don't you have any curiosity? Don't you want to taste glory?
	Just say 'yes'. 
	
	// if answer is still 'no'. 
	Too bad. Just a heads up, you actually have to enter a code. The only exit to this world
	is inside. 
	
	// answer to 'yes'
	Great! (*Hint: Hmmm... where there any clues along the way?)
	
	Code: _ _ _ 

// hangman thing: _ _ _. 
// player enters "THE". 

Great! You opened the cave! The sea floor shakes, and the boulder rolls slightly to the side, revealing 
a gap just large enough for you to enter. 

// enter cave

INSIDE CAVE
Almost there! You enter into an underwater sea cave. It is about the size of a small room. 
There are more luminous rocks, this time covering the cave walls and ceiling like a star 
constellation. In the middle of the room is a mirror.

//look in mirror

You see your own reflection looking back at you in the mirror. You look like death. Your hair
is a mess, you have dark bags under your eyes, and your clothes are torn from this journey. 
But, you smile. You made it this far and you're proud of that. You gasp as you relive a memory...

"_" smiled at you on his birthday. You gave him the book he had his eye on for years about the
midnight zone sea creatures. "_", your best friend. He was a huge dork when it came to marine 
animals. "_" had a huge obsession and was practically a walking encyclopedia. 

Loading... 

But something happened. The last time he saw you, he was really scared. He had to do something
that would be extraordinarily dangerous. And he warned you, what were his last words? Something
about staying away from him... 

You blink again, and the flashback is gone. You look in the mirror, and you see yourself looking
fresh and healthy, like someone who didn't just almost die in the deep sea. There is also the faint
outline of a silver key glowing in your jeans pocket. You look down at yourself. Shocked, you realize
you are no longer a walking zombie. You reach into your pocket and pull out a silver key. Two keys
down! It is added into your inventory.

A swirl of light glows around you and you blank out...  
 
END OF LEVEL 2: EXIT THE SEA WORLD
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 3: Earth World
You wake up, gasping for air only to find yourself in a strange place.
Your eyes readjusts after facing the sun and you regain sight. You notice the blades of grass that are tall 
enough to brush against your face when the wind whistles.  The sky has transitioned to red and blue in such a
 way that you can see the purple start to appear. You finally feel relaxed as you breathe in the lilac scented air.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 4: Volcano

You find yourself on the edge of a volcano, terrified you look around only to be pushed by an invisible force inside the volcano. 
You scream and hit the ground but are still alive. 
You look around and see a bunch of flames surrounding you but realize when you reach out to touch them they don't burn you.
You decide to start walking around come across a 



You find the last key word KEYS and open the chest to find the fourth key.
You go back to the main and realize that there are 4 slots in this door. 
You insert  keys you found and all of your memories come flooding back to your mind and realize that you can now escape.
