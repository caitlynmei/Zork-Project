Beginning: Dialogue and intro to the game

Level 0: 
It's dark. You hear a distant voice and open your eyes to find that you're in a cage. 
The cage is inside a dark airplane hanger. It is night time.

 
Level 0 activities:

Walk around the cage (each direction is blocked by bars, so you can't go anywhere)


Ground is cold cement. You are wearing a T-Shirt and worn out jeans. You are wearing dress shoes covered in dust.
You don't remember who you are, where you came from or even what your name is. A dark figure approaches the cage shown by the 
little back light of the night sky. 
Mysterious figure : 
"Look who decided to finally wake up"

You:
options to say -
		"Who are you?" - "Where am I?"  

			Answer to "Who are you": 
			"You don't Remember? You don't remember the hell you put me through? Well, that will make this
			more enjoyable. I might feel a bit guilty after though...."
			
			Answer to "Where am I":
			"You are in a place where you will finally get what you deserve."

You:
options to say - 
		
		"What do you mean?" - "I don't remember..."

The dark figure starts laughing as their figure fades from the dimly lit airplane hanger.
