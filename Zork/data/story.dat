Beginning: Dialogue and intro to the game

It's dark. You hear a distant voice and open your eyes to find that you're in a cage. 
The cage is inside a dark airplane hanger. It is night time.

Level 0 activities:

Walk around the cage (each direction is blocked by bars, so you can't go anywhere)
North - Front of the cage
South - Back of the cage
West - Left of the cage
East - Right of the cage

Ground is cold cement. You are wearing a T-Shirt and worn out jeans. You are wearing dress shoes covered in dust.
You don't remember who you are, where you came from or even what your name is. A dark figure approaches the cage shown by the 
little back light of the night sky.
  
Mysterious figure : 
"Look who decided to finally wake up"

You:

		"Who are you?" - "Where am I?"

			more enjoyable. I might feel a bit guilty after though...."
			
				- Continues on
			
			Answer to "Where am I":

		Answer to both:
		"You will see very soon... have fun"
		

*Evil Laughter sound*
The dark figure starts laughing as their figure fades from the dimly lit airplane hanger. 

.. wait about 3 seconds before executing next line of code .. 

*clicking sound*
Suddenly the ground beneath you collapses and you fall. Everything goes dark.



// we should have a leaflet to read instructions like Zork does - CM

// Or at least have a game intro explanation - CM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1: Air World 

You wake up on a fluffy surface. You look around to see blue skies and the bright sun in the Morning sky.
Squinting, you look around to see a ground of white fluff which seems to resemble the clouds you are used to seeing above your head.
You try to remember how you got here, but only remember the scary figure that greeted you from outside the cage you were
trapped in. 

start level one


When you open the chest at the end of the level (or however u get out):

the clouds around you start to disappear one by one.

Options - 
Hang onto the chest - The chest disappears into thin air, you fall on your face.
Do nothing - You watch as the clouds around you disappear. Eventually the cloud underneath you also disappears. 
You Fall. Everything goes dark.
Close your eyes -  You close your eyes, and hope for the best. The anticipation is high and you anxiously wait for the cloud beneath
you, to disappear. You lose consciousness.  

You see a child skipping on a hot summers day. "Do I know her?" you ask yourself. She starts skipping away. "Wait!" you call. Everything
fades to black.

Start Level 2

Level 2: Water World


** Caitlyn make sure you think of the memories the guy gets back or just leave that to me when u r done - Gaby
->	goal of this world player has to find a chest with a key inside. 
	It is the golden key of truth. You dissolve into the sand and 
	reappear in Earth World (in a muddy swamp). 
	
You wake up lying on your back in pitch dark. You can hear the sound of waves crashing 
against cave walls.

You stand up cautiously.

// user has to move eventually, so any move will make you fall into a hole...

Ahhhhhhhhhh....... You fall into a deep dark hole and die...
Just joking. But you do fall into a hole and submerge into water. 
*SPLASH*

WATER SURFACE
You are fighting for your life to keep your head above the water surface. Thankfully, you 
know how to swim. You don't see anything above water other then dark gloomy clouds
and murky water. There is just water, water, and more water. 
(*HINT: go under the surface. It's more interesting)

// person goes underwater

UNDER THE SEA (BELOW WATER SURFACE)
There is a colourful coral reef covering the sea floor. *You can now use the commands up (U) 
and down (D) alongside the normal compass directions. The water surface is above you, but the
dark dullness doesn't seem inviting. The only way left is down. 

// person goes down

CORAL REEF
You are now on the sea floor with the exotic reefs. To the east, there is a sign. You realize
you are holding your breath under the water. You will run out of air soon. To the west, there 
is a trail of bubbles coming from something that looks like a large ... purple ... rock? 

// go west

GIANT PURPLE CLAM
There is a giant purple clam!! (In case you didn't read the title) You watch the clam breath
out a trail of bubbles. The bubbles float upwards on top of the clam. You think, that's cute. 
But, not really. You're head hurts. You NEED oxygen. Now. 

A small silver clownfish swims into the bubbles and is caught in one. *THINK* 
(*HINT: The bubbles have air. What do you need?)

// you swim up on top of the clam
// You take a bubble and place it on top of your head 
// If you DON'T, sadly you run out of air and suffocate. Sorry!! Good game. 

// if the user is an underwater astronaut...
Good thinking!! You're like an underwater astronaut with the bubble helmet. Now you're free
to 'traverse' the ocean as you wish. :)

//look
There is a sign to the east. 

// walk to the sign
// read sign

INTRO SIGN
"BEWARE: SHARK!!! 
Just stay inside the KELP FOREST to the east. 

// east

You see a shark!! Run away!!

// east

KELP FOREST
There is a vast wall of kelp looming over you. This forest has been proven to be a good 
hidding spot. To the west is a sign. 

KELP FOREST
You see kelp all around you in this thick and dim forest light. 

// east

KELP FOREST
You see a faint glow ahead in the midst of all the kelp.

In the middle of the kelp forest, you see a glowing rock shaped like a "T". Hmmm...

// east

KELP FOREST
You see a beam of light to the east. 

// east

OTHER SIDE OF THE KELP FOREST
The light is glowing stronger... Hallelujah!! You are out of the kelp forest!! 
If you turn back you will die from the shark. There is a dark vast space of water beneath
you. It's a one way ride. (You can follow the wall down where the bottom drops off)

// down

MIDNIGHT ZONE
The abyss of gloom. It's actually not that scary. 
*Unless, you have a a fear of the dark. In that case, good luck 'cause 
this is the only path available for you. *MWAH HA HA HA*  // HAH OK - GG

// down

MIDNIGHT ZONE
Look! Pretty bioluminescent jellyfish let you see in the dark. 

// down
// on west side of midnight zone, there is glowing turqoise stone.

MIDNIGHT ZONE
There is a turqoise glow coming from the west, on the side of the wall. 

// west; down

WALL LEDGE 
Oooh, a glowing truqoise stone is on the ledge. There is a note under the stone.

// take stone
// take note
// read note

MIDNIGHT ZONE NOTE
Good luck making if so far. If you still can't remember much right now, here's a clue. 

/ rhyme of whatever we want the guy to remember...
.
.
.
.

And there's also an "H". Hmmm... 

// any move

CURRENT MOVING DOWN
You are caught in a current!
Tumbling and tumbling and tumbling...
Deeper and deeper into the sea...
And...

ABYSS FLOOR
Finally you stop. The current took you to the bottom of the abyss. You are on the floor of the abyss.
Another school of bioluminescent fish swim by. You see a another sign beside you. 

// read sign

ABYSS SIGN
Good job once more! Follow the path of the glow in the dark road.
"E" 
Hmmmm.... interesting, another letter.

// look
ABYSS FLOOR
Bottom of the abyss in the midnight zone.

Level 3: Earth World
You wake up, gasping for air only to find yourself in a strange place.
Your eyes readjusts after facing the sun and you regain sight. You notice the blades of grass that are tall 
enough to brush against your face when the wind whistles.  The sky has transitioned to red and blue in such a
 way that you can see the purple start to appear. You finally feel relaxed as you breathe in the lilac scented air.
